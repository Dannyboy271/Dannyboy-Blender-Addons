# Dannyboy-Blender-Addons
Everything AWESOME!!!

This is where I'll put any addons I make for Blender 3D. 

Most addons are GPL (General Public License) and can be edited, redistrbuted, and so forth for whatever reason, SIMPLY because they contain Blender API. I'd like for any editors of my stuff to at least give me credit for the creations if you edit, but that is up to you.

They'll also be released in their solid addon format inside .zip files. So to install, just unzip, open Blender, open User Preferences > Addons > Install from file, then check the little "Enable" checkbox, and fire away!!
